Seize this great opportunity to join the Americas Control Room Team where you will focus on providing real-time compliance advice and support to all business lines including ECM, DCM, Mergers and Acquisitions, principal investments, lending and syndication, and research among others.

The Americas Control Room forms part of the Global Control Room team, with current staff in Asia, London, New York, Jacksonville and Sydney, providing 24 hour coverage and having responsibility for implementing a number of key group-wide policies designed to ensure Macquarie fulfils its legal obligations, manages its conflicts of interest and avoids reputational damage.

In this role you will review, maintain, provide advice and guidance consistent with the firm’s policies and procedures, including but not limited to Information Barriers and Confidentiality, Personal Trading and Gate Keeper Policies, perform initial Conflicts assessment and finally, raise escalations where necessary. You will work with the Local Manager and other Senior Staff to design procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and best practices, conduct initial review of research, as well as investment banking and financing transactions for evidence of conflicts.

In addition to the above responsibilities you will assist in the oversight and maintenance of the Firm’s Watch and Restricted lists for the region and implement, communicate, and maintain restrictions on trading and advice. Lastly, you will work with Senior Staff to support the position monitoring/reporting process and work with others within Legal, Risk Management Group Compliance and Business Management to undertake regulatory filings as required and assist and facilitate Wall Crossings from initial request to the resumption of normal duties and maintenance and administration of associated systems.

Your degree and experience in a financial service, investment banking, broker-dealer or regulatory environment as well as having working knowledge of global capital markets and understanding of the U.S. regulatory environment are highly desirable. Excellent written and communication skills are imperative for this role, as well as your initiative and good eye for detail. Having completed FINRA series exams would be advantageous.

If you are looking for a new and exciting challenge, apply today.
